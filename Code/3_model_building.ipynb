    "Using the labeled feature data set constructed in the `Code/2_feature_engineering.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, this notebook loads the data from the Azure Blob container and splits it into a training and test data set. We then build a machine learning model (a decision tree classifier or a random forest classifier) to predict when different components within our machine population will fail. We store the better performing model for deployment in an Azure web service in the next. We will prepare and build the web service in the `Code/4_operationalization.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "A fundamental practice in machine learning is to calibrate and test your model parameters on data that has not been used to train the model. Evaluation of the model requires splitting the available data into a training portion, a calibration portion and an evaluation portion. Typically, 80% of data is used to train the model and 10% each to calibrate any parameter selection and evaluate your model.\n",

    "In general random splitting can be used, but since time series data have an inherent correlation between observations. For predictive maintenance problems, a time-dependent spliting strategy is often a better approach to estimate performance. For a time-dependent split, a single point in time is chosen, the model is trained on examples up to that point in time, and validated on the examples after that point. This simulates training on current data and score data collected in the future data after the splitting point is not known. However, care must be taken on labels near the split point. In this case, feature records within 7 days of the split point can not be labeled as a failure, since that is unobserved data. \n",

    "A particualar troubling behavior in predictive maintenance is machine failures are usually rare occurrences compared to normal operation. This is fortunate for the business as maintenance and saftey issues are few, but causes an imbalance in the label distribution. This imbalance leads to poor performance as algorithms tend to classify majority class examples at the expense of minority class, since the total misclassification error is much improved when majority class is labeled correctly. This causes low recall or precision rates, although accuracy can be high. It becomes a larger problem when the cost of false alarms is very high. To help with this problem, sampling techniques such as oversampling of the minority examples can be used. These methods are not covered in this notebook. Because of this, it is also important to look at evaluation metrics other than accuracy alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build and compare two different classification model approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Decision trees and their ensembles are popular methods for the machine learning tasks of classification and regression. Decision trees are widely used since they are easy to interpret, handle categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, do not require feature scaling, and are able to capture non-linearities and feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Random Forest Classifier**: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Random forests combine many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting. Tree ensemble algorithms such as random forests and boosting are among the top performers for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will to compare these models in the AML Workbench _runs_ screen. The next code block creates the model. You can choose between a _DecisionTree_ or _RandomForest_ by setting the 'model_type' variable. We have also included a series of model hyperparameters to guide your exploration of the model space."
